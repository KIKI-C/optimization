# optimization
Optimization simulations using both Excel and Python 

Excel has profound functions in simulations leveraging solver, crystal ball, senslt, decision tree, @risk, simquick and etc. 
It's intuitional but not not for heavy computing tasks.

With an idea from Excel simulations, I built simulations in python.
